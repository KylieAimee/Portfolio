    <h3>Art Journey</h3>
    <p>
        I have enjoyed creating art since I was a kid. I have used many different mediums, mainly tradition
        and some of my favourites  are:
    </p>
    <!---Ordered list-->
    <ol>
        <p>
            <li><b>Graphite</b>: I love how easily you can work with it, 
            and how realistic images can get with it, though it can be 
            hard to get those dark blacks</li>
        </p>
        <p>
            <li><b>Charcoal</b>: I love how even more realistic and dark you 
            can get your images, although it can get very messy</li>
        </p>
        <p>
            <li><b>Watercolour</b>: I love how it looks and how easily art 
                can be created with it, especially more abstract art, 
                although mistakes can be made very easily</li>
        </p>
        <p>
            <li><b>Pencil Crayon</b>: I love how you can blend them 
                and the soft images that can be created with them</li>
        </p>
        <p>
            <li><b>Digital</b>: I love how easily things can be deleted or 
                undone without leaving marks, and how perfessional it can look, 
                though it can be a big learning curve</li>
        </p>
    </ol>


    <p>
        Currently I am learning Digital art for graphic design.
